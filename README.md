### Install SDK
Create a virtual environment to build your package
```shell
virtualenv conductor
source conductor/bin/activate
```

Get Conductor Python SDK
```shell
python3 -m pip install conductor-python
```
#### Setup SDK
SDK requires connecting to the Conductor server and optionally supplying with authentication parameters.

```python
from conductor.client.configuration.configuration import Configuration

configuration = Configuration(
    server_api_url='https://play.orkes.io/api',
    debug=False  # set to true for verbose logging
)
```
Configure the authentication settings if your Conductor server requires authentication.
```python
from conductor.client.configuration.configuration import Configuration
from conductor.client.configuration.settings.authentication_settings import AuthenticationSettings

configuration = Configuration(
    authentication_settings=AuthenticationSettings(
        key_id='key',
        key_secret='secret'
    )
)
```

See [Access Control](https://orkes.io/content/docs/getting-started/concepts/access-control) for guide to getting API keys

### Build and run hello-world
Create a `workflow.py`
```python

```

### Implement Worker
