"""Suite 25: Media Input — image sent TO a vision model via ``media=``.

This is the inverse of Suite 7 (media *generation*): here an image is passed as
**input** on ``runtime.run(..., media=[...])`` and we verify a vision-capable
model actually receives and reads it.

Deterministic, non-LLM-judged validation (per repo CLAUDE.md): the image
contains a distinctive, machine-unguessable token ("MELON7391"). The agent is
asked to transcribe the text; we assert the exact token appears in the final
answer. The model cannot produce that token unless it truly saw the image —
which is the whole point of the ``media`` parameter.

**Self-contained image.** The PNG is committed alongside this test
(``assets/melon7391.png``) and read at import time — the suite has NO runtime
dependency on any external image host. The server reads media itself and
rejects data URIs, so the test writes those bytes to a file and passes its path. The server only reads files
under its allowed media directory, which defaults to ``~/worker-payload/`` (the
directory used when ``conductor.file-storage.parentDir`` is unset — the default
``agentspan server start`` config). This assumes the server runs on the same
host as the test — the standard local / bundle e2e setup. Set
``AGENTSPAN_MEDIA_DIR`` to override the directory for deployments that
configure a custom allowed media dir.

Parametrized across providers. The Anthropic positive case is ``skip``ped: in
current server builds media is forwarded to OpenAI but NOT attached to the
Anthropic provider request (the model receives no image), so the token is never
read. Remove the skip once the server forwards media for Anthropic (see
SUITE25_ANTHROPIC_SKIP_REASON).

No mocks. Real server, real vision model.
