"""Short Movie Pipeline — sequential content generation stages.

Demonstrates:
    - SequentialAgent with 5 specialized stages
    - Each stage builds on previous output (concept → script → visuals → audio → assembly)
    - Tools at each stage for structured output

Inspired by the Google ADK short-movie-agents sample which uses
a multi-stage pipeline for creative content production.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
