"""Google ADK Agent with Streaming — real-time event streaming.

Demonstrates:
    - Streaming events from a Google ADK agent running on Conductor
    - The runtime.stream() method works identically for foreign agents
    - Events include: thinking, tool_call, tool_result, done

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with Google Gemini LLM integration configured
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
