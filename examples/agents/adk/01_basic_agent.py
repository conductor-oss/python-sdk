"""Basic Google ADK Agent — simplest possible agent.

Demonstrates:
    - Defining an agent using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
    - Running it on the Conductor agent runtime (auto-detected)
    - The runtime serializes the agent generically and the server
      normalizes the ADK-specific config into a Conductor workflow.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with Google Gemini LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable

        # runtime.deploy(agent)
        # CLI alternative:
        # agentspan deploy --package examples.adk.01_basic_agent
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(agent)
