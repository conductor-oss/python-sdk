"""Google ADK AgentTool — agent-as-tool invocation.

Demonstrates:
    - Using AgentTool to wrap an agent as a callable tool
    - The parent agent's LLM invokes the child agent like a function
    - The child agent runs its own tools and returns the result
    - Unlike sub_agents (handoff), AgentTool runs inline and returns

Architecture:
    manager (parent agent)
      tools:
        - AgentTool(researcher)   <- child agent with its own tools
        - AgentTool(calculator)   <- another child agent

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with AgentTool support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
