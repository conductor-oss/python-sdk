"""Google ADK Shared State — tools sharing state via ToolContext.

Tools can read and write ``context.state``, a dictionary that persists
across tool calls within the same agent execution.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with state support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
