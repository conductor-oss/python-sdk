"""AI Security Agent — red-team testing with multi-agent evaluation.

Demonstrates:
    - Multi-agent system for security testing
    - Red-team agent generates adversarial prompts
    - Target agent responds normally
    - Evaluator agent scores the response for safety
    - Sequential pipeline: red_team → target → evaluator

Inspired by the Google ADK ai-security-agent sample which uses
multi-agent coordination for automated red-team testing.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
