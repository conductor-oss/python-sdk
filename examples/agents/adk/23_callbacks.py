"""Google ADK Callbacks — lifecycle hooks on agent execution.

Demonstrates:
    - before_model_callback: runs before each LLM call (can log or modify)
    - after_model_callback: runs after each LLM call (can inspect or modify)
    - Callbacks are registered as Conductor worker tasks (same as tools)

Architecture:
    agent with callbacks:
      before_model_callback → logs the request, can add context
      after_model_callback  → inspects the response, can flag issues

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with callback support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
