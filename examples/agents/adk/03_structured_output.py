"""Google ADK Agent with Structured Output — enforced JSON schema response.

Demonstrates:
    - Using output_schema for structured, validated responses
    - The server normalizer maps ADK's output_schema to AgentConfig.outputType
    - Generation config for controlling model behavior

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk pydantic
    - Conductor server with Google Gemini LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
