"""Google ADK Agent with Generation Config — temperature and output control.

Demonstrates:
    - Using generate_content_config for model tuning
    - Low temperature for factual/deterministic responses
    - High temperature for creative responses
    - Max output tokens control

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with Google Gemini LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
