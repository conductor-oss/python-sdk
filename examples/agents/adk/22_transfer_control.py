"""Google ADK Transfer Control — restricted agent handoffs.

Demonstrates:
    - disallow_transfer_to_parent: prevents sub-agent from returning to parent
    - disallow_transfer_to_peers: prevents sub-agent from transferring to siblings
    - These map to allowedTransitions in the Conductor workflow

Architecture:
    coordinator (parent)
      sub_agents:
        - specialist_a (can only talk to specialist_b, not parent)
        - specialist_b (can talk to anyone)
        - specialist_c (can only talk to parent, not peers)

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with transfer control support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
