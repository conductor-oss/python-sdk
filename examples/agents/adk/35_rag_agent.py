"""Google ADK RAG Agent — vector search + document indexing.

Mirrors the pattern from google/adk-samples/RAG but uses Conductor's native
RAG system tasks (LLM_INDEX_TEXT, LLM_SEARCH_INDEX) instead of Vertex AI
RAG Engine.

Demonstrates:
    - index_tool to populate a vector database with documents
    - search_tool to query the indexed documents
    - End-to-end validation: index first, then search

Architecture:
    rag_assistant (root agent)
      tools:
        - search_knowledge_base  # search_tool → LLM_SEARCH_INDEX
        - index_document         # index_tool → LLM_INDEX_TEXT

Supported vector databases:
    - pgvectordb (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
    - pineconedb (Pinecone)
    - mongodb_atlas (MongoDB Atlas Vector Search)

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with RAG system tasks enabled (--spring.profiles.active=rag)
    - A configured vector database (e.g., pgvector)
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash in .env or environment
