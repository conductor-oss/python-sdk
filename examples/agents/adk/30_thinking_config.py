"""Google ADK Thinking Config — extended reasoning for complex tasks.

Uses ADK's ThinkingConfig to enable extended thinking mode,
allowing the LLM to reason step-by-step before responding.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with thinking config support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
