"""Google ADK Nested Strategies — ParallelAgent inside SequentialAgent.

Demonstrates composing agent strategies: parallel research runs
concurrently, then results flow into a sequential summarizer.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
