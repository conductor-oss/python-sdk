"""Safety Guardrails — global safety enforcement using LLM-as-judge.

Demonstrates:
    - Output guardrails that evaluate every agent response
    - Combining multiple safety checks (PII detection, harmful content)
    - Using sequential pipeline to enforce guardrails

Inspired by the Google ADK safety-plugins sample which uses
BasePlugin for global safety. We use guardrails + sequential agents.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
