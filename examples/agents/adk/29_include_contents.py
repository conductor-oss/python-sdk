"""Google ADK Include Contents — control context passed to sub-agents.

When ``include_contents="none"``, a sub-agent starts fresh without
the parent's conversation history.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk

    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
