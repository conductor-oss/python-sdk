"""Google ADK Hierarchical Agents — multi-level agent delegation.

Demonstrates:
    - Hierarchical multi-agent architecture
    - A top-level coordinator delegates to team leads
    - Team leads delegate to specialist agents with tools
    - Deep nesting of sub_agents

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with Google Gemini LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
