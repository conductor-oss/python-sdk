"""Callbacks — before_tool_callback and after_tool_callback for tool interception.

Mirrors the pattern from Google ADK samples (customer-service).
Callbacks can validate tool inputs, modify outputs, or short-circuit execution.

NOTE: ADK callbacks (before_tool_callback, after_tool_callback, before_model_callback,
after_model_callback) are Python-side hooks that run within the ADK framework.
When compiled to Conductor workflows, these callbacks are serialized but may not
execute server-side. This example demonstrates the ADK API pattern.
