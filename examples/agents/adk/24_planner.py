"""Google ADK BuiltInPlanner — agent with planning step.

Demonstrates:
    - Using BuiltInPlanner to add a planning phase before execution
    - The agent creates a step-by-step plan, then follows it
    - Mapped to system prompt enhancement on the server side

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
