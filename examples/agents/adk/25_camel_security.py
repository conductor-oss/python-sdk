"""CaMeL-inspired Security Policy Agent — controlled data flow.

Demonstrates:
    - Multi-agent system with security policy enforcement
    - Guardrails to prevent sensitive data leakage
    - Sequential pipeline: collector → validator → responder

Inspired by the Google ADK camel sample which uses CaMeL framework
for secure, controlled LLM agent data flow.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
