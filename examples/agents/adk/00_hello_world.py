"""Minimal Google ADK greeting agent — for debugging the native runner.

The simplest possible ADK agent: no tools, no structured output, one turn.
Used to verify the ADK native shim works end-to-end before testing more
complex examples.

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - GOOGLE_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash (for Conductor runs)
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api (for Conductor runs)

        # Production pattern:
        # 1. Deploy once during CI/CD:
        # runtime.deploy(agent)
        # CLI alternative:
        # runtime.deploy(agent) from a release script
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(agent)
