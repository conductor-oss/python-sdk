"""Google ADK Agent with Instruction Templating — dynamic {variable} injection.

Demonstrates:
    - ADK's instruction templating with {variable} syntax
    - Variables resolved from session state at runtime
    - Agent behavior changes based on injected context

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server with Google Gemini LLM integration configured
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash as environment variable
