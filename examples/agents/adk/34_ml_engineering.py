"""Google ADK ML Engineering Pipeline — multi-agent ML workflow.

Mirrors the pattern from google/adk-samples/machine-learning-engineering (MLE-STAR).
Demonstrates:
    - SequentialAgent pipeline with distinct ML phases
    - ParallelAgent for concurrent model strategy exploration
    - LoopAgent for iterative refinement (ablation-style)
    - output_key for state passing between pipeline stages

Architecture:
    ml_pipeline (SequentialAgent)
      sub_agents:
        1. data_analyst       — Analyze dataset, identify features, recommend approaches
        2. parallel_modeling   — (ParallelAgent) Explore 3 model strategies concurrently
           - linear_modeler   — Linear/regularized model approach
           - tree_modeler     — Tree-based ensemble approach
           - nn_modeler       — Neural network approach
        3. evaluator          — Compare approaches, select best candidate
        4. refinement_loop    — (LoopAgent) Iterative hyperparameter optimization
           - write_refine     — (SequentialAgent)
             - optimizer      — Suggest improvements
             - validator      — Check if improvements are meaningful
        5. reporter           — Generate final summary report

Requirements:
    - pip install google-adk
    - Conductor server
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api in .env or environment
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=google_gemini/gemini-2.0-flash in .env or environment
