"""Constrained Speaker Transitions — control which agents can follow which.

Demonstrates ``allowed_transitions`` which restricts which agent can
speak after which.  Useful for enforcing conversational protocols.

In this example, a code review workflow enforces:
    - developer can only be followed by reviewer
    - reviewer can only be followed by developer or approver
    - approver can only be followed by developer (for revisions)

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
