"""Wait for Message — continuously receive messages via Workflow Message Queue.

Demonstrates:
    - wait_for_message_tool: dequeues messages from the WMQ (Conductor PULL_WORKFLOW_MESSAGES task)
    - Mixing a server-side message tool with a local Python action tool
    - Looping agent that keeps processing messages indefinitely
    - Pushing messages from outside the workflow with runtime.send_message()

The agent loops forever: each iteration waits for a message, reads the
"task" field, executes it, and goes back to listening.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with WMQ support (conductor.workflow-message-queue.enabled=true)
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
