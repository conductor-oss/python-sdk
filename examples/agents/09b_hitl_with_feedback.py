"""Human-in-the-Loop with Custom Feedback.

Demonstrates the general-purpose `respond()` API.  Instead of a binary
approve/reject, the human can send arbitrary feedback that the LLM
processes on its next iteration.  Uses interactive streaming with
schema-driven console prompts.

Use case: a content-publishing agent writes a blog post, and a human
editor can approve, reject, or provide revision notes.  The agent
incorporates the feedback and tries again.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
