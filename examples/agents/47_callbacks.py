"""Callbacks — lifecycle hooks before and after LLM calls.

Demonstrates using ``before_model_callback`` and ``after_model_callback``
to intercept and inspect LLM interactions. Callbacks are registered as
Conductor worker tasks and execute server-side.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with callback support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
