"""Fan-out / Fan-in — orchestrator broadcasts tasks to multiple worker agents,
then collects and aggregates all results.

Demonstrates:
    - Fan-out: one Orchestrator agent sending the same task to N Worker agents
      by calling runtime.send_message once per worker, all from a single @tool
    - Fan-in: each Worker sends its result into the Collector agent's WMQ so
      results arrive independently in any order
    - Three roles, five concurrently running workflows:
        Orchestrator — receives questions from main, fans them out
        Worker ×3    — receives a task, produces an answer, pushes to Collector
        Collector    — receives 3×N results, builds side-by-side reports
    - Unique tool names per worker: Conductor routes tasks by definition name,
      so workers sharing a name would race for each other's tasks.  Each worker
      gets tools named submit_answer_<name> / stop_collector_<name>.
    - Filesystem IPC:
        * Workers write sentinels after submit_answer so main counts completions
        * Collector writes reports to files; main thread reads and prints them
        * stop_* sentinels tell main all agents have cleanly shut down
    - No time.sleep() to assume message delivery — all synchronisation via files

Scenario:
    A research Orchestrator fans out each question to three Worker agents
    (alpha, beta, gamma) that produce independent short answers.  The Collector
    aggregates the three answers into a side-by-side comparison report.

Requirements:
    - AgentSpan server running at http://localhost:6767
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514
