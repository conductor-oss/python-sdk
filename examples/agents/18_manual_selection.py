"""Manual Selection — human picks which agent speaks next.

Demonstrates ``strategy="manual"`` where the workflow pauses each turn
to let a human select which agent should respond.  The human interacts
via the ``AgentHandle.respond()`` API.

Flow:
    1. Workflow pauses with a HumanTask showing available agents
    2. Human picks an agent (e.g. {"selected": "writer"})
    3. Selected agent responds
    4. Repeat until max_turns

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
