"""GPTAssistantAgent — wrap OpenAI Assistants API as a Conductor agent.

Demonstrates ``GPTAssistantAgent`` which uses the OpenAI Assistants API
(with threads, runs, and built-in tools like code_interpreter) as a
Conductor agent.

Two modes:
    1. Use an existing assistant by ID
    2. Create a new assistant on-the-fly with model + instructions

Requirements:
    - pip install openai
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable

        # 1. Deploy once during CI/CD:
        # runtime.deploy(data_analyst)
        # CLI alternative:
        # runtime.deploy(agent) from a release script
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(data_analyst)
