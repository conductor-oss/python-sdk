"""Skills — Load conductor skill for workflow management.

Demonstrates:
    - Loading a skill with scripts (conductor_api.py) as auto-wrapped tools
    - Progressive disclosure: reference docs loaded on demand via read_skill_file
    - Each conductor_api call is a visible SIMPLE task in the Conductor DAG
    - Composing the conductor skill with /dg in a multi-agent team

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - conductor-skills installed (https://github.com/conductor-oss/conductor-skills)

Install conductor-skills:
    git clone https://github.com/conductor-oss/conductor-skills ~/.claude/skills/conductor-skills
    # The skill is at ~/.claude/skills/conductor/
