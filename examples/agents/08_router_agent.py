"""Router Agent — LLM-based routing to specialists.

Demonstrates the router strategy where a dedicated router/classifier agent
decides which specialist sub-agent handles each request.

Architecture:
    team (ROUTER, router=selector)
    ├── planner   — design/architecture tasks
    ├── coder     — implementation tasks
    └── reviewer  — code review tasks

The selector is a separate agent whose only job is routing.
It is NOT one of the specialist agents.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
