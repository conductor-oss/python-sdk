"""Router to Sequential — route to a pipeline sub-agent.

Demonstrates a router that selects between a single agent (for quick
answers) and a sequential pipeline (for research tasks requiring
multiple stages).

Architecture:
    team (ROUTER, router=selector)
    ├── quick_answer          (single agent)
    └── research_pipeline     (SEQUENTIAL)
        ├── researcher
        └── writer

The router agent decides which path to take based on the request.
If it picks the pipeline, the researcher runs first and the writer
summarizes the findings.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini in .env or environment
