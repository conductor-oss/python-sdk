"""Stateful Agent Resume — reconnect to a running workflow after runtime restart.

Demonstrates:
    - Starting a stateful agent with WMQ (wait_for_message_tool)
    - Closing the runtime (workers die, workflow persists on server)
    - Resuming with runtime.resume() — domain automatically extracted from
      the server's taskToDomain mapping, no run_id needed
    - Workers re-register under the original domain, workflow continues

How this works:
    Phase 1: Start the agent, send a task, let it process, then close the
    runtime.  Workers die but the workflow is durable on the server — it
    stays in RUNNING state, waiting for a message that has no worker to
    deliver it.

    Phase 2: Create a fresh AgentRuntime and call resume(execution_id, agent).
    resume() fetches the workflow from the server, reads its taskToDomain
    mapping to discover the domain UUID, and re-registers workers under that
    domain.  The server dispatches stalled tasks to the new workers and the
    agent picks up where it left off.

Why stateful matters:
    Without stateful=True, all workers register in the default Conductor
    domain.  Multiple concurrent instances of the same agent would steal
    each other's tasks.  With stateful=True, each execution gets a unique
    domain UUID — workers are isolated per execution.  resume() must
    register workers under the ORIGINAL domain, which it extracts from
    the server automatically.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with WMQ support (conductor.workflow-message-queue.enabled=true)
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
