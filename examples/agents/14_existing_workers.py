"""Existing Workers — use @worker_task functions as agent tools.

Demonstrates:
    - Passing existing @worker_task functions directly as agent tools
    - Mixing @worker_task and @tool functions in a single agent
    - No re-wrapping or boilerplate needed

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - conductor-python installed (provides @worker_task)
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
