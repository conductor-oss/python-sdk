"""Swarm: Claude Code builds a React app, OpenAI reviews it, iterate until approved.

Architecture:
    build_review_swarm (orchestrator, anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5, SWARM strategy)
        ├── builder  (claude-code/sonnet — Write, Edit, Bash, Read)
        └── reviewer (openai/gpt-4o — text-only code review)

    builder ──HANDOFF_TO_REVIEWER──> reviewer
    reviewer ──HANDOFF_TO_BUILDER──> builder  (if issues found)
    reviewer ──APPROVED──> done

Demonstrates:
    - Mixed-model multi-agent: Claude Code for building, OpenAI for reviewing
    - SWARM orchestration with handoffs between different agent types
    - Claude Code agent as a sub-agent in a multi-agent workflow

Usage:
    uv run python examples/claude_agent_sdk/05_build_and_review.py
