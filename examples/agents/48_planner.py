"""Planner — agent that plans before executing.

When ``enable_planning=True``, the server enhances the system prompt with
planning instructions so the agent creates a step-by-step plan before executing
tools. This improves performance on complex, multi-step tasks.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with planner support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
