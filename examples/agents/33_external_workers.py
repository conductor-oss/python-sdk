"""External Worker Tools — reference workers running in other services.

Demonstrates ``@tool(external=True)`` for referencing Conductor workers that
exist in another repository, service, or language.  The function stub provides
the schema (via type hints) and description (via docstring), but **no local
worker is started** — Conductor dispatches the task to whatever worker is
polling for that task definition name.

This is useful when:
    - Workers are written in Java, Go, or another language
    - Workers run in a separate microservice
    - You want to reuse existing Conductor task definitions without duplicating code

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - The referenced workers must be running somewhere
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
