"""Credentials — HTTP tool with server-side credential resolution.

Demonstrates:
    - http_tool() with credentials=["GITHUB_TOKEN"]
    - ${GITHUB_TOKEN} in headers resolved server-side (not in Python)
    - No worker process needed — Conductor makes the HTTP call directly

The ${NAME} syntax in headers tells the server to substitute the credential
value from the store at execution time. The plaintext value never appears
in the workflow definition.

Setup (one-time):
    agentspan credentials set GITHUB_TOKEN <your-github-token>
Requirements:
    - Agentspan server running at AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set (or defaults to openai/gpt-5.4)
    - GITHUB_TOKEN stored via `agentspan credentials set`
