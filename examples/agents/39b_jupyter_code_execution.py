"""Jupyter kernel code execution — persistent state across calls.

The ``JupyterCodeExecutor`` runs code in a real Jupyter kernel.  Variables,
imports, and definitions persist between executions — just like cells in a
notebook.  Perfect for data-science workflows where analysis is built up
step by step.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - pip install jupyter_client ipykernel
    - export AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
