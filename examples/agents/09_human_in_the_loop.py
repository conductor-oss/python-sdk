"""Human-in-the-Loop — approval workflows.

Demonstrates how tools with approval_required=True pause the workflow
until a human approves or rejects the action.  Uses interactive streaming
with schema-driven console prompts to handle the HITL pause.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
