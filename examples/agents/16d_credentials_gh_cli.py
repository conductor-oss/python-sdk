"""Credentials — GitHub CLI (gh) with automatic credential injection.

Demonstrates:
    - cli_allowed_commands=["gh"] gives the agent a run_command tool
    - credentials=["GH_TOKEN"] auto-injects the token into the tool env
    - The agent calls `gh` commands directly — no subprocess boilerplate needed

Setup (one-time, via CLI):
    Conductor login
    the Conductor server credential store
Requirements:
    - Conductor server running at CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL set (or defaults to openai/gpt-5.4)
    - `gh` CLI installed (https://cli.github.com)
    - GH_TOKEN stored via `the Conductor server credential store`

        # runtime.deploy(agent) from a release script

        # runtime.serve(agent)
