"""Simple agent guardrails — output validation without tools.

Demonstrates guardrails on a **simple agent** (no tools, no sub-agents).
The agent is compiled with a DoWhile loop that retries the LLM call when
a guardrail fails — same durable retry behavior as tool-using agents.

This example uses mixed guardrail types:

- ``RegexGuardrail`` — compiled as a Conductor InlineTask (server-side
  JavaScript, no Python worker needed)
- Custom ``@guardrail`` function — compiled as a Conductor worker task
  (runs in the SDK's worker process)

Both guardrails run inside the same DoWhile loop.  If either fails with
``on_fail="retry"``, the feedback message is appended to the conversation
and the LLM tries again.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
