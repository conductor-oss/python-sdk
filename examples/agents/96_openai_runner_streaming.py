"""OpenAI Agents SDK migration — streaming.

This is examples/basic/stream_text.py from the openai-agents SDK
with exactly ONE line changed.

Before (runs directly against OpenAI):
    from agents import Runner

After (runs on Agentspan — durable, observable, scalable):
    from conductor.ai import Runner

The diff:
    -from agents import Runner
    +from conductor.ai import Runner

Agentspan's streaming model differs from openai-agents in that it streams
*execution events* (LLM calls, tool calls, results) rather than tokens.
The final response arrives in the "done" event's output field.

Event types:
    "thinking"    — an LLM or tool task has started (content = task name)
    "tool_call"   — the LLM called a tool (tool_name, args)
    "tool_result" — a tool completed (tool_name, result)
    "message"     — an intermediate agent message
    "done"        — execution complete; output contains the final answer
    "error"       — execution failed

Requirements:
    - uv add openai-agents
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o

Usage:
    python 96_openai_runner_streaming.py
