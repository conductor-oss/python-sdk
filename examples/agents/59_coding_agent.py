"""Coding Agent with QA Tester — write, review, and fix code.

Demonstrates:
    - Swarm orchestration: agents decide when to hand off
    - Coder writes code, transfers to QA when ready
    - QA tester reviews and runs tests, transfers back if bugs found
    - Natural back-and-forth until QA approves the code
    - Extended thinking for step-by-step reasoning

Flow (swarm — LLM-driven handoffs):
    1. coder writes the solution, executes it, transfers to qa_tester
    2. qa_tester reviews code, writes and runs tests
       - if bugs found → transfers back to coder
       - if all tests pass → done
    3. coder fixes issues, re-runs, transfers to qa_tester
    4. qa_tester verifies fixes → done

Requirements:
    - Conductor server running
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
