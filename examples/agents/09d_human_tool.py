"""Human Tool — LLM-initiated human interaction.

Unlike approval_required tools (09_human_in_the_loop.py) where humans gate
tool execution, ``human_tool`` lets the LLM **ask the human questions** at
any point.  The LLM decides when to call the tool, and the human's response
is returned as the tool output.

The tool is entirely server-side (Conductor HUMAN task) — no worker process
needed.  The server generates the response form and validation pipeline
automatically, so this works with any SDK language.  Uses interactive
streaming with schema-driven console prompts.

Demonstrates:
    - ``human_tool()`` for LLM-initiated human interaction
    - Mixing human tools with regular tools
    - The LLM using human input to make decisions

Requirements:
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL (default: openai/gpt-4o-mini)
