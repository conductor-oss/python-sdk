"""Sequential Pipeline — Agent >> Agent >> Agent.

Demonstrates the sequential strategy where agents run in order and the
output of each agent becomes the input of the next.

Also shows the >> operator shorthand.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
