"""Human-in-the-Loop with Streaming — Console Interactive.

Streams agent events in real time via SSE.  When the agent pauses for
human approval, the user is prompted in the console with schema-driven
prompts and responds through the handle.

Use case: an ops agent that can restart services (safe) and delete data
(dangerous, requires approval).  The operator watches the agent think
in real time and intervenes only for destructive actions.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
