"""Credentials — OpenAI Agent SDK with credential injection.

Demonstrates:
    - runtime.run(openai_agent, credentials=["GITHUB_TOKEN"]) for OpenAI agents
    - Credentials resolved from server and injected into os.environ
    - OpenAI agent tools can read credentials from os.environ

Setup (one-time):
    agentspan credentials set GITHUB_TOKEN <your-github-token>
Requirements:
    - Agentspan server running at AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set (or defaults to openai/gpt-5.4)
    - GITHUB_TOKEN stored via `agentspan credentials set`
    - openai-agents installed: pip install openai-agents
