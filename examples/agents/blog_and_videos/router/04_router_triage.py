"""Issue Triage Bot — split-brain routing with a dedicated classifier.

A cheap classifier agent (gpt-4o-mini) reads each issue and picks the
right specialist. The specialist (gpt-4o) does the actual work. Two
brains, each doing what it is good at.

Setup:
    pip install Conductor
    Conductor server start

    python split-the-brain.py
