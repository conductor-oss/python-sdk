"""LLM Guardrails — AI-powered content safety evaluation.

Demonstrates ``LLMGuardrail`` which uses a separate (typically smaller/faster)
LLM to evaluate whether agent output meets a policy.

The guardrail LLM receives the policy + content and judges pass/fail.

This example also demonstrates guardrails on a **simple agent** (no tools).
Simple agents are compiled with a DoWhile loop when guardrails are present,
so the LLM retries automatically on guardrail failure.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - pip install litellm (for the guardrail LLM call)
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
    - OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... as environment variable
