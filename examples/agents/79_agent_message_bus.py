"""Agent Message Bus — two agents communicating via Workflow Message Queue.

Demonstrates:
    - Agent-to-agent messaging: one running agent sending messages directly
      into another running agent's WMQ via runtime.send_message()
    - A tool that closes over an execution_id to forward results downstream
    - Parallel agent pipelines: researcher → writer running concurrently
    - Filesystem-based IPC: forward_to_writer writes sentinel files so the main
      thread knows when all topics have been forwarded
    - Deterministic stop: handle.stop() exits each agent's loop gracefully

How this differs from 06_sequential_pipeline:
    The >> operator in example 06 compiles a static DAG upfront — the workflow
    is defined before execution starts and the runtime automatically passes the
    output of agent A as input to agent B.  Here, both agents are independent
    running workflows.  The Researcher decides at runtime when and what to
    forward, and could in theory send to multiple Writers or skip forwarding
    conditionally.  For the basic "A feeds B" pattern example 06 is simpler;
    use this pattern when you need dynamic, conditional, or fan-out routing
    between concurrently running agents.

Scenario:
    A Researcher agent receives topics, produces bullet-point research notes,
    then forwards them to a Writer agent that turns the notes into a polished
    paragraph.  The main script only sends topics to the Researcher — the
    Researcher autonomously drives the Writer.

Requirements:
    - AgentSpan server running at http://localhost:6767
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
