"""Agent Introductions — agents introduce themselves before a discussion.

Demonstrates the ``introduction`` parameter on Agent, which adds a
self-introduction to the conversation transcript at the start of
multi-agent group chats (round_robin, random, swarm, manual).

This helps agents understand who they're collaborating with and
establishes context for the discussion.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
