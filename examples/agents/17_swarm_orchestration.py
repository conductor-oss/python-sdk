"""Swarm Orchestration — automatic agent transitions via transfer tools.

Demonstrates ``strategy="swarm"`` with LLM-driven, tool-based handoffs.
Each agent gets ``transfer_to_<peer>`` tools and the LLM decides when to
hand off by calling the appropriate transfer tool.

Condition-based handoffs (OnTextMention, etc.) remain as optional fallback
when no transfer tool is called.

Flow:
    1. Parent support agent triages the initial request (runs as agent "0")
    2. Support agent sees tools: [transfer_to_refund_specialist, transfer_to_tech_support]
    3. LLM calls transfer_to_refund_specialist() → inner loop exits
    4. Handoff check detects transfer → active_agent switches to "1"
    5. Refund specialist handles the request (no transfer) → loop exits
    6. Output: refund specialist's clean response

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
