"""Random Strategy — random agent selection each turn.

Demonstrates the ``strategy="random"`` pattern where a random sub-agent
is selected each iteration.  Unlike round-robin (fixed rotation), random
selection adds variety — useful for brainstorming or diverse perspectives.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
