"""Serve from Package — auto-discover and serve all agents in a package.

Demonstrates:
    - runtime.serve(packages=["myapp.agents"]) — auto-discovery
    - Scanning Python packages for module-level Agent instances
    - Mixing explicit agents with package-based discovery

discover_agents() recursively imports the specified packages and
collects all module-level Agent instances. This avoids the need to
explicitly list every agent when serving a large codebase.

    python 63d_serve_from_package.py

Requirements:
    - Conductor server running
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
    - A Python package with Agent instances at module level
