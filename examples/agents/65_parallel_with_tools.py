"""Parallel Agents with Tools — each branch has its own tools.

Extends the basic parallel pattern (example 07) by giving each parallel
branch its own domain tools. All branches run concurrently and each
independently calls its tools.

Architecture:
    parallel_analysis
    ├── financial_analyst  (tools: [check_balance])
    └── order_analyst      (tools: [lookup_order])

Both analysts run at the same time on the same input. Their results
are aggregated by the parent.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini in .env or environment
