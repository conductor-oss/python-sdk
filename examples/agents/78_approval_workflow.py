"""Approval Workflow — agent dynamically decides which tasks need human sign-off.

Demonstrates:
    - wait_for_message_tool as a dynamic approval gate driven by LLM reasoning
    - The agent itself decides mid-loop whether a task is risky, rather than
      the workflow being designed with an explicit approval step upfront
    - flag_for_approval blocks until the operator decides, returning "approve"
      or "reject" directly — no second wait_for_message needed for the decision,
      which prevents the agent from pulling the next task while approval is pending
    - Filesystem-based IPC between the main process and worker processes:
      tool workers run as separate OS processes (different PIDs, same filesystem),
      so @tool functions use sentinel files to communicate with the main thread
    - Clean shutdown: the agent responds with no tool calls on the stop signal,
      which lets the DoWhile loop exit naturally (workflow ends COMPLETED)

How this differs from examples 09a–09d (HITL):
    In 09a–09d the approval pause is a WaitTask node baked into the workflow
    definition at compile time — the workflow always pauses at that point
    regardless of the input.  Here, the LLM inspects each incoming task and
    decides dynamically whether it is safe to execute immediately or requires
    human sign-off.  Low-risk tasks flow through without any pause; only
    high-risk ones trigger the blocking flag_for_approval call.  The workflow
    structure is uniform — it is the agent's reasoning that introduces the
    conditional gate.

Scenario:
    An operations agent processes a stream of system commands.  Safe commands
    (status checks, reads) run immediately.  Destructive or sensitive commands
    (deletes, restarts, permission changes) are held pending approval.  All
    tasks are dispatched upfront; the agent processes them sequentially and
    blocks on flag_for_approval until the operator responds.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server running at http://localhost:8080
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
