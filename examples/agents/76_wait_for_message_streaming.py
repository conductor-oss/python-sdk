"""Wait for Message (Streaming) — send messages to a running agent and stream its responses.

Demonstrates:
    - wait_for_message_tool with streaming: push messages in and see the agent react
    - Using handle.stream() to observe WAITING → processing → WAITING cycles
    - runtime.send_message() to push payloads into the Workflow Message Queue

The agent starts, immediately waits for a message, processes whatever it
receives (by calling wait_for_message again), then waits again.  The caller
drives the conversation by sending messages and reading streamed events.

Requirements:
    - AgentSpan server running at http://localhost:8080
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
