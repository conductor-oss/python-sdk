"""Safety Guardrails Pipeline — PII detection and sanitization.

Demonstrates a sequential pipeline where a safety checker agent scans
the primary agent's output for PII and sanitizes it before delivery:

    assistant → safety_checker

- **assistant**: A helpful agent that answers questions (may include PII).
- **safety_checker**: Scans the response for PII (emails, phones, SSNs,
  credit cards) using regex-based tools and sanitizes any matches.

This pattern uses tool-based PII detection rather than the built-in
guardrail system, showing how sequential agents can enforce safety
policies through explicit scanning and redaction.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
