"""Thinking Config — enable extended reasoning for complex tasks.

When ``thinking_budget_tokens`` is set, the agent uses extended thinking
mode, allowing the LLM to reason step-by-step before responding. This
improves performance on complex analytical tasks at the cost of higher
token usage.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with thinking config support
    - A model that supports extended thinking (e.g., Claude with thinking)
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
