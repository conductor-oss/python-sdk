"""Credentials — Framework passthrough with credential injection.

Demonstrates:
    - runtime.run(graph, credentials=["GITHUB_TOKEN"]) for LangGraph agents
    - Credentials resolved from the server and injected into os.environ
      before the graph executes
    - Works the same for LangChain, OpenAI Agent SDK, and Google ADK

This pattern is used when you run a foreign framework agent (LangGraph,
LangChain, OpenAI, ADK) through Agentspan and need tools inside the
graph to access credentials from the credential store.

Setup (one-time):
    agentspan credentials set GITHUB_TOKEN <your-github-token>
Requirements:
    - Agentspan server running at AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set (or defaults to openai/gpt-5.4)
    - GITHUB_TOKEN stored via `agentspan credentials set`
    - langgraph installed: pip install langgraph langchain-openai
