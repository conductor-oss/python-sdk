"""Include Contents — control context passed to sub-agents.

When ``include_contents="none"``, a sub-agent starts with a clean slate
and does NOT see the parent agent's conversation history. This is useful
for sub-agents that should work independently without being influenced
by prior messages.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with include_contents support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
