"""Long-Running Agent — fire-and-forget with status checking.

Demonstrates starting an agent asynchronously and checking its status
from any process. The agent runs as a Conductor workflow and can be
monitored from the UI or via the API.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable

        # 1. Deploy once during CI/CD:
        # runtime.deploy(agent)
        # CLI alternative:
        # runtime.deploy(agent) from a release script
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(agent)

        # Async handle alternative:
        # handle = runtime.start(agent, "What are the key metrics to track for a SaaS product?")
