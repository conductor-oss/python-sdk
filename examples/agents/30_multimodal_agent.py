"""Multimodal Agent — analyze images and video with vision-capable models.

Demonstrates multimodal input via the ``media`` parameter on
``runtime.run()``.  Pass image or video URLs alongside your text prompt —
the Conductor server includes them in the ChatMessage ``media`` field,
enabling vision-capable models (GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude) to see them.

Supported media types:
    - Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP (URL or data URI)
    - Video: MP4, MOV (provider-dependent, e.g. Gemini)
    - Audio: MP3, WAV (provider-dependent)

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support (OpenAI key configured)
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
