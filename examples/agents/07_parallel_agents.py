"""Parallel Agents — fan-out / fan-in.

Demonstrates the parallel strategy where all sub-agents run concurrently
on the same input and their results are aggregated.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
