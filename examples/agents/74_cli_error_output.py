"""CLI error output — verify the agent sees stdout/stderr on non-zero exit.

Runs an agent that deliberately triggers a failing CLI command and then
asks the agent to report what it saw.  The test passes when the agent's
final output contains the stderr text produced by the failed command.

Requirements:
  - Conductor server with LLM support
  - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL  (e.g. http://localhost:8080/api)
  - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL   (e.g. openai/gpt-4o-mini)
