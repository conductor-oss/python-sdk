"""Nested Strategies — parallel agents inside a sequential pipeline.

Demonstrates composing strategies: a ParallelAgent phase runs multiple
research agents concurrently, followed by a sequential summarizer.

    pipeline = parallel_research >> summarizer

Requirements:
    - Conductor server
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
