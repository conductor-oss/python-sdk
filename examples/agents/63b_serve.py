"""Serve — keep tool workers running as a persistent service.

Demonstrates:
    - runtime.serve() to register Python workers and block until interrupted
    - Serving multiple agents in a single process
    - Decoupled from deploy: workers only, no workflow registration

serve() registers the Python tool functions (tools, custom guardrails,
callbacks, handoff checks) as Conductor workers and starts polling for
tasks. The workflow must already exist on the server (from a prior
deploy() or run() call, possibly in a different process).

Start this in a long-running process (systemd, Docker, k8s pod).
Press Ctrl+C to stop.

    python 63b_serve.py

Requirements:
    - Conductor server running
    - Agents already deployed (run 63_deploy.py first)
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini in .env or environment
