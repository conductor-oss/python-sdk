"""Live Dashboard — a Feeder agent streams metrics into a Monitor agent in real time.

This example shows how WMQ can be used as a live data channel between two
concurrently running agents.  The Feeder pushes metric samples as fast as it
can; the Monitor consumes them in batches and prints an aggregated dashboard
line after each batch.  Neither agent knows at compile time how many messages
will arrive or when — the LLM reacts to whatever shows up in its queue.

Key WMQ concept — batch_size:
    wait_for_message_tool accepts a batch_size parameter.  Instead of waking
    up for every individual message, the Monitor dequeues up to 10 samples per
    call and processes them together.  This is useful when messages arrive in
    bursts and you want the LLM to reason over a window rather than one item
    at a time.

How it works:
    1. Monitor starts first; its execution_id is shared with the Feeder via a
       file (workers run as separate OS processes, so in-process objects are not
       shared — the filesystem is the coordination channel).
    2. The main script sends batch signals to the Feeder via WMQ.
    3. The Feeder dequeues each signal, generates 5 random metric samples
       (cpu, memory, request-rate, latency, error-rate), and pushes them
       directly into the Monitor's WMQ queue via runtime.send_message().
    4. The Monitor wakes up, pulls up to 10 samples at once, computes
       min/max/avg per metric, and calls display_dashboard with a summary line.
    5. Once all batches are confirmed dispatched and all dashboard summaries
       received, the main script sends a stop signal to the Feeder, which
       forwards it to the Monitor before itself stopping cleanly.

How this differs from 79_agent_message_bus:
    Example 79 has the Researcher forward structured content (research notes)
    to the Writer one item at a time.  Here, the Feeder pushes raw numeric
    samples as fast as possible and the Monitor aggregates them in batches —
    the pattern is closer to a metrics pipeline or log aggregator than a
    content pipeline.
