"""Guardrails — output validation with tool calls.

Demonstrates a guardrail that catches PII leaking from tool results into
the agent's final answer.  The agent uses two tools:

1. get_order_status  — returns safe order data (no PII)
2. get_customer_info — returns data that includes a credit card number

The PII guardrail checks the agent's final output.  If the agent includes
the raw credit card number in its response, the guardrail fails with
on_fail="retry" — the agent retries with feedback asking it to redact
the PII.

For agents with tools, guardrails are compiled into the Conductor DoWhile
loop as durable workflow tasks.  This means:
- Guardrail retries happen inside the workflow (no full re-execution)
- Guardrails are visible in the Conductor UI
- They work with ``start()`` and ``stream()`` (not just ``run()``)

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
