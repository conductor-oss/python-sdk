"""Agent Handoff — transferring control between specialized agents.

Demonstrates:
    - Explicit handoff from a triage agent to a specialist
    - Using state flags to control which agent is active
    - Each specialist has its own focused prompt and tools
    - Practical use case: customer service triage → billing / technical / general routing

Requirements:
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
    - OPENAI_API_KEY for ChatOpenAI
