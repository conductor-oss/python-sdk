"""Multi-Turn Conversation — MemorySaver + session_id for continuity.

Demonstrates:
    - Using MemorySaver checkpointer for persistent conversation history
    - Passing session_id to runtime.run for scoped memory
    - How different session IDs maintain separate conversation threads
    - A practical use case: interview preparation assistant

Requirements:
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
    - OPENAI_API_KEY for ChatOpenAI
