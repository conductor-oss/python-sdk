"""Research Agent — create_agent with search, summarize, and cite_source tools.

Demonstrates:
    - Combining search, summarization, and citation tools in one agent
    - Mock implementations that return realistic research-style data
    - Building a multi-step research workflow via tool chaining

Requirements:
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
    - OPENAI_API_KEY for ChatOpenAI
