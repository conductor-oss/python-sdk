"""Context Condensation Stress Test — orchestrator + sub-agents, history condenses 3+ times.

An orchestrator agent calls a ``deep_analyst`` sub-agent once per technology
domain.  The sub-agent fetches structured domain facts and writes a
comprehensive ~600-word LLM-generated analysis.  Each result lands in the
orchestrator's conversation history as a large tool-call output (~800 tokens).
After roughly 10 calls the accumulated history exceeds the configured context
window and the Conductor server automatically condenses it.  This repeats
~3 times across the 25 domains.

Architecture::

    orchestrator (create_agent)
      └── deep_analyst (create_agent, SUB_WORKFLOW) × 25 topics
              └── fetch_domain_data(domain)  ← structured facts/stats

What to watch in server logs (INFO level)::

    Condensed conversation from 22 to 12 messages (triggered by proactive (exceeds context window))
    Condensed conversation from 22 to 12 messages (triggered by proactive (exceeds context window))
    Condensed conversation from 22 to 12 messages (triggered by proactive (exceeds context window))

Setup — required for condensation to trigger
---------------------------------------------
Add to ``server/src/main/resources/application.properties`` and restart::

    agentspan.default-context-window=10000

Requirements:
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
