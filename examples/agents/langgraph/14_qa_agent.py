"""QA Agent — StateGraph that retrieves context then generates an answer.

Demonstrates:
    - Two-stage pipeline: retrieve context, then generate answer
    - Mocked retrieval step that returns relevant passages
    - Grounded answer generation using retrieved context

Requirements:
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
    - OPENAI_API_KEY for ChatOpenAI
