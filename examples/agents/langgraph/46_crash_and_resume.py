"""Crash & Resume — restart workers after a process crash.

Demonstrates the production pattern for durable LangGraph execution:
    - deploy() registers the workflow definition on the server (one-time)
    - start() triggers an execution via the server API
    - serve() registers Python workers and keeps them polling
    - After a crash, just restart serve() — the server dispatches stalled
      tasks to the new workers and the execution resumes automatically

How this works:
    Phase 1: Deploy the agent definition, start an execution, and serve
    workers briefly.  Close the runtime to simulate a crash — workers die
    but the workflow is durable on the server.

    Phase 2: Create a fresh AgentRuntime and call serve(graph).  This
    re-serializes the graph, re-registers the same workers, and starts
    polling.  The server sees workers available again and dispatches any
    stalled tasks.  The execution picks up where it left off — no special
    resume logic, no execution_id needed.

Why this matters:
    LangGraph graphs running through Agentspan are compiled into durable
    Conductor workflows.  If your process crashes (OOM, deploy, exception),
    no work is lost — the server holds the workflow state.  You just need
    to restart serve() and the workers pick up from where they left off.

Production pattern:
    # CI/CD (once):
    runtime.deploy(graph)

    # Long-running worker process (restart on crash):
    runtime.serve(graph)

    # Trigger executions from anywhere:
    runtime.start("sales_analyst", "prompt")  # or via server API / UI

Requirements:
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
    - OPENAI_API_KEY for ChatOpenAI
