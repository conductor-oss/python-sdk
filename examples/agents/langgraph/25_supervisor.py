"""Supervisor — multi-agent supervisor pattern.

Demonstrates:
    - A supervisor LLM that decides which specialist agent to call next
    - Routing control flow based on the supervisor's decision
    - Collecting outputs from specialized sub-agents
    - Practical use case: research → writing → editing pipeline with supervisor control

Requirements:
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
    - OPENAI_API_KEY for ChatOpenAI
