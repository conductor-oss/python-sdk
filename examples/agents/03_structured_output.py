"""Structured Output — Pydantic output types.

Demonstrates how to get typed, validated responses from an agent
using Pydantic models.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - pydantic installed
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable

        # Production pattern:
        # 1. Deploy once during CI/CD:
        # runtime.deploy(agent)
        # CLI alternative:
        # agentspan deploy --package examples.03_structured_output
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(agent)
