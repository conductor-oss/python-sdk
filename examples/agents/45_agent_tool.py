"""Agent Tool — wrap an agent as a callable tool.

Unlike sub-agents (which use handoff delegation), an agent_tool is invoked
inline by the parent LLM like a function call. The child agent runs its
own workflow and returns the result as a tool output.

    manager (parent)
      tools:
        - agent_tool(researcher)   <- child agent with search tool
        - calculate                <- regular tool

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with AgentTool support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
