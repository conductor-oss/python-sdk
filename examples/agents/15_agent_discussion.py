"""Agent Discussion — durable round-robin debate compiled to a Conductor DoWhile loop.

Demonstrates a multi-turn discussion between agents with opposing
viewpoints using the ``round_robin`` strategy.  The entire debate runs
server-side as a Conductor DoWhile loop — durable, restartable, and
observable in the Conductor UI.  After the discussion, a summary agent
distills the transcript into a balanced conclusion via the ``>>``
pipeline operator.

Flow (all server-side):
    DoWhile(6 turns):
        turn 0 → optimist
        turn 1 → skeptic
        turn 2 → optimist
        ...
    summarizer produces conclusion

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
