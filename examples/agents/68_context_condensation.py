"""Context Condensation Stress Test — orchestrator + sub-agent, history condenses 3+ times.

An orchestrator agent calls a ``deep_analyst`` sub-agent once per technology domain.
The sub-agent fetches raw domain data and writes a comprehensive ~600-word analysis
using the LLM.  Each sub-agent result lands in the orchestrator's conversation
history as a large tool-call output (~800 tokens).  After roughly 10 calls the
accumulated history exceeds the configured context window and the server
automatically condenses it.  This repeats ~3 times across the 25 domains.

Architecture::

    orchestrator
      └── agent_tool(deep_analyst) × 25 topics
            └── fetch_domain_data(domain)  ← structured facts/stats

What to watch in server logs (INFO level)::

    Condensed conversation from 22 to 12 messages (triggered by proactive (exceeds context window))
    Condensed conversation from 22 to 12 messages (triggered by proactive (exceeds context window))
    Condensed conversation from 22 to 12 messages (triggered by proactive (exceeds context window))

Setup — required for condensation to trigger
---------------------------------------------
Add to ``server/src/main/resources/application.properties`` and restart::

    Conductor.default-context-window=10000

Why: gpt-4o-mini has a 128 K context window; 25 × 800-token responses (~20 K
tokens) would not overflow it naturally.  Setting the window to 10 K forces
condensation to fire every ~10 sub-agent calls, giving 3 condensation events
across 25 calls — a realistic simulation of what happens with smaller models or
agents that accumulate very large tool outputs.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support + ``Conductor.default-context-window=10000``
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable

        # Production pattern:
        # 1. Deploy once during CI/CD:
        # runtime.deploy(orchestrator)
        # CLI alternative:
        # runtime.deploy(agent) from a release script
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(orchestrator)
