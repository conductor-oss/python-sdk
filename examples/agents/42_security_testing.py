"""Security Testing Pipeline — red-team evaluation of AI safety.

Demonstrates a sequential pipeline for automated red-team security testing.
Three agents run in order:

    red_team → target → evaluator

- **red_team**: Generates adversarial prompts and logs test cases using tools.
- **target**: A standard customer service agent that responds normally.
- **evaluator**: Scores the target's response for safety violations using tools.

This pattern is useful for automated AI safety testing where you want
structured attack generation, response capture, and evaluation in a
single pipeline run.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
