"""Run Monitoring Agent — trigger the monitoring agent deployed by 63d.

Demonstrates:
    - Running a deployed agent by workflow name from a separate process
    - The deploy/serve/run separation in practice

Requirements:
    - Conductor server running
    - 63d_serve_from_package.py running in another terminal
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api in .env or environment

        # Production pattern:
        # 1. Deploy once during CI/CD:
        # runtime.deploy(...)
        # CLI alternative:
        # agentspan deploy --package examples.63e_run_monitoring
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(...)
