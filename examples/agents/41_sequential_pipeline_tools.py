"""Sequential Pipeline with Stage-Level Tools — movie production pipeline.

Demonstrates the sequential strategy where EACH sub-agent in the pipeline
has its own tools for producing structured output. Each stage builds on
the previous one's output:

    concept_developer → scriptwriter → visual_director → audio_designer → producer

This shows how to give individual pipeline agents their own tools while
composing them into an ordered sequence using the >> operator.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
