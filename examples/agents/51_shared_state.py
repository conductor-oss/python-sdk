"""Shared State — tools sharing state across calls via ToolContext.

Tools can read and write to ``context.state``, a dictionary that persists
across all tool calls within the same agent execution. This enables
tools to accumulate data, maintain counters, or pass information between
different tool invocations without relying on the LLM to relay state.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with state support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
