"""Credentials — MCP tool with server-side credential resolution.

Demonstrates:
    - mcp_tool() with credentials=["MCP_API_KEY"]
    - ${MCP_API_KEY} in headers resolved server-side before MCP calls
    - MCP server authentication handled transparently

MCP Test Server Setup (mcp-testkit):
    pip install mcp-testkit

    # Start with auth (to demonstrate credential resolution):
    mcp-testkit --transport http --auth <secret>

    # Store credentials via CLI or Conductor UI:
    the Conductor server credential store

Requirements:
    - Conductor server running at CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL set (or defaults to openai/gpt-4o-mini)
    - mcp-testkit running on http://localhost:3001 (see setup above)
    - MCP_API_KEY stored via CLI or Conductor UI
