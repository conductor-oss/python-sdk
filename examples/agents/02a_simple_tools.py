"""Simple Tool Calling — two tools, the LLM picks the right one.

The agent has two tools: one for weather, one for stock prices.
Based on the user's question, the LLM decides which tool to call.

In the Conductor UI you'll see each tool call as a separate task
(DynamicTask) with its inputs and outputs clearly visible.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
