"""Deterministic Stop — exit an agent loop without LLM cooperation.

Demonstrates:
    - handle.stop(): graceful, deterministic loop exit via workflow variable
    - No stop-handling instructions needed in the agent's prompt
    - Execution reaches COMPLETED status with last output preserved
    - Works with both blocking and non-blocking WMQ agents

How it works:
    The server compiles every agent's DoWhile loop with a ``_stop_requested``
    workflow variable in its condition.  When ``handle.stop()`` is called, the
    SDK sets this variable to ``true`` via Conductor's ``updateVariables`` API.
    The loop condition evaluates to ``false`` on the next check, and the loop
    exits.  The LLM cannot override this — it's checked by Conductor, not the
    LLM.

    For blocking WMQ agents, ``stop()`` also sends a ``{"_signal": "stop"}``
    WMQ message to unblock the ``PULL_WORKFLOW_MESSAGES`` task so the current
    iteration can finish.

stop() vs cancel():
    - stop()   → graceful, current iteration finishes, status=COMPLETED
    - cancel() → immediate, workflow killed, status=TERMINATED

The old pattern (still works, but non-deterministic):
    Previously, stopping required LLM cooperation — the agent's instructions
    had to include "if you see {stop: true}, respond with no tool calls".
    The LLM could ignore this.  handle.stop() makes this unnecessary.

Requirements:
    - Agentspan server (with _stop_requested support in compiler)
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
