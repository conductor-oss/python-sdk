"""Deploy — register agents on the server (CI/CD step).

Demonstrates:
    - runtime.deploy() to compile and register multiple agents
    - DeploymentInfo result with registered name and agent name
    - CI/CD use case: push agent definitions without executing them

deploy() sends agent configs to the server, which compiles them into
Conductor workflow definitions and registers the corresponding task
definitions. No local workers are started, no execution happens.

Run this once during deployment. Use serve() separately (63b) to keep
workers alive, or use `runtime.run()` directly in app code and keep
deploy/serve as the production pattern.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server running
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini in .env or environment
