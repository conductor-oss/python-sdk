"""Semantic Memory — long-term memory with similarity-based retrieval.

Demonstrates ``SemanticMemory`` for persisting facts across sessions
and retrieving relevant context based on semantic similarity.

The memory is injected into the agent's system prompt at runtime,
giving the agent access to relevant past knowledge.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable

        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
