"""120 — OCG-backed long-term memory with human good/bad feedback links.

Enable memory on an agent and the runtime does two things automatically:

  - BEFORE a run: relevant past memories (scoped to this agent/user) are
    retrieved from OCG and injected into the prompt — no tool call needed.
  - AFTER a run: the conversation is summarized (Claude-style: durable facts,
    not the raw transcript) by a small internal summarizer agent and saved back
    to OCG as a memory.

Feedback is HUMAN-only. Agents never vote. Instead, the runtime hands a
``FeedbackEvent`` — including signed *capability URLs* (good/bad) — to the
agent's ``feedback_sink``. A human (e.g. a support engineer) clicks a link to
mark the memory good or bad; the link skips auth (its signature is the
authorization), so the clicker needs no OCG account. Here the sink just prints
the URLs as they'd appear in a Zendesk ticket comment.

Requires the OCG instance to be started with a feedback-link secret
(``OCG_FEEDBACK_LINK_SECRET``) for the capability URLs to be minted.

Run (from the repo root)::

    OCG_INSTANCE_URL=https://test.contextgraph.io \
    OCG_TOKEN=<bearer-token> \
    uv run python examples/agents/120_ocg_memory.py

    # against an embedded server, also set AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL.
