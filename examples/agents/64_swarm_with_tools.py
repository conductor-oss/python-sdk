"""Swarm with Tools — sub-agents have their own domain tools.

Extends the basic swarm pattern (example 17) by giving each specialist
its own tools. The swarm transfer mechanism works alongside the tools:
the LLM can call domain tools AND transfer tools in the same turn.

Flow:
    1. Front-line support triages the request
    2. Calls transfer_to_billing_specialist or transfer_to_order_specialist
    3. Specialist uses its domain tool (check_balance / lookup_order)
    4. Specialist responds with the result

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini in .env or environment
