"""Multi-Step Tool Calling — chained lookups and calculations.

The agent has four tools. The prompt requires it to:
1. Look up a customer's account
2. Fetch their recent transactions
3. Calculate the total spend
4. Formulate a final answer using all the data

This shows the agent loop in action: the LLM calls tools one at a
time, feeds each result into the next decision, and stops when it has
enough information to answer.

In the Conductor UI you'll see each tool call as a separate DynamicTask
with clear inputs/outputs, making it easy to trace the reasoning chain.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
