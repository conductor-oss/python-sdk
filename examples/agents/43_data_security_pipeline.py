"""Data Security Pipeline — controlled data flow with redaction.

Demonstrates a sequential pipeline with data flow control where
sensitive information is collected, redacted, and then presented safely:

    collector → validator → responder

- **collector**: Fetches raw user data using tools (includes PII).
- **validator**: Redacts sensitive fields (SSN, balances, email) using tools.
- **responder**: Presents the safe, redacted data to the user.

This pattern enforces a security boundary between data access and
user-facing responses, ensuring PII never reaches the final output.

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
