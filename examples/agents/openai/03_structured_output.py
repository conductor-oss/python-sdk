"""OpenAI Agent with Structured Output — enforced JSON schema response.

Demonstrates:
    - Using output_type with a Pydantic model for structured responses
    - The agent is forced to return data matching the schema
    - Model settings (temperature) for deterministic output

Requirements:
    - pip install openai-agents pydantic
    - Conductor server with OpenAI LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
