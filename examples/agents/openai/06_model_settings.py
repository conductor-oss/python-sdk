"""OpenAI Agent with Model Settings — temperature, max tokens, and more.

Demonstrates:
    - Configuring ModelSettings for fine-tuned LLM behavior
    - Low temperature for deterministic responses
    - Max tokens limit
    - The server normalizer maps model_settings to AgentConfig temperature/maxTokens.

Requirements:
    - pip install openai-agents
    - Conductor server with OpenAI LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
