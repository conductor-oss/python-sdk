"""Basic OpenAI Agent — simplest possible agent with no tools.

Demonstrates:
    - Defining an agent using the OpenAI Agents SDK
    - Running it on the Conductor agent runtime (auto-detected)
    - The runtime serializes the agent generically and the server
      normalizes the OpenAI-specific config into a Conductor workflow.

Requirements:
    - pip install openai-agents
    - Conductor server with OpenAI LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable

        # runtime.deploy(agent)
        # CLI alternative:
        # agentspan deploy --package examples.openai.01_basic_agent
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(agent)
