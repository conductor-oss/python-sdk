"""OpenAI Agent with Streaming — real-time event streaming.

Demonstrates:
    - Streaming events from an OpenAI agent running on Conductor
    - The runtime.stream() method works identically for foreign agents
    - Events include: thinking, tool_call, tool_result, done

Requirements:
    - pip install openai-agents
    - Conductor server with OpenAI LLM integration configured
    - CONDUCTOR_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - CONDUCTOR_AGENT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
