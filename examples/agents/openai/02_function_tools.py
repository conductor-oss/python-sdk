"""OpenAI Agent with Function Tools — tool calling via @function_tool.

Demonstrates:
    - Using OpenAI's @function_tool decorator for tool definitions
    - Multiple tools with typed parameters
    - The Conductor runtime auto-extracts callables, registers them as
      workers, and the server normalizes function tools into worker tasks.

Requirements:
    - pip install openai-agents
    - Conductor server with OpenAI LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
