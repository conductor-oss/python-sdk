"""OpenAI Agent Handoffs — multi-agent orchestration with handoffs.

Demonstrates:
    - Defining specialist agents with handoff capability
    - A triage agent that routes to the correct specialist
    - The Conductor runtime maps OpenAI handoffs to strategy="handoff"
      with sub-agents, compiled into a multi-agent workflow.

Requirements:
    - pip install openai-agents
    - Conductor server with OpenAI LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
