"""OpenAI Agent with Dynamic Instructions — callable instruction function.

Demonstrates:
    - Using a callable function for dynamic instructions
    - Instructions that change based on context (time of day, user info, etc.)
    - Function tools alongside dynamic instructions

Requirements:
    - pip install openai-agents
    - Conductor server with OpenAI LLM integration configured
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable
