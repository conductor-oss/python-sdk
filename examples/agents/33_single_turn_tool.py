"""Single-Turn Tool Call — LLM calls a tool and answers in one shot.

The simplest tool-calling pattern: the user asks a question, the LLM
calls a tool to get data, then responds with the answer.  No iterative
loop — the agent runs for exactly one exchange.

Compiled workflow:

    LLM(prompt, tools) → tool executes → LLM sees result → answer

Requirements:
    - Conductor server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api as environment variable
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o-mini as environment variable

        # Production pattern:
        # 1. Deploy once during CI/CD:
        # runtime.deploy(agent)
        # CLI alternative:
        # agentspan deploy --package examples.33_single_turn_tool
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(agent)
