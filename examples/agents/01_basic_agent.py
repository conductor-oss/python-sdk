"""Basic Agent — 5-line hello world.

Demonstrates the simplest possible agent: define an agent, call
``runtime.run()``, and print the result.

Requirements:
    - Agentspan server with LLM support
    - AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api in .env or environment
    - AGENTSPAN_LLM_MODEL set in .env or environment (optional)

        result = runtime.run(agent, prompt)
        result.print_result()

        # Production pattern:
        # 1. Deploy once during CI/CD:
        # runtime.deploy(agent)
        # CLI alternative:
        # agentspan deploy --package examples.01_basic_agent
        #
        # 2. In a separate long-lived worker process:
        # runtime.serve(agent)
