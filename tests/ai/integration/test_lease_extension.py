"""E2E test for Conductor lease extension (heartbeat) behavior.

The Python SDK registers all worker tasks with ``response_timeout_seconds=10``
and ``lease_extend_enabled=True``.  The worker sends periodic heartbeats
(at 80 % of the timeout window) to extend the lease.

This test creates a tool that takes longer than the 10 s timeout.
If lease extension is working, the task completes normally.
If it is broken, the task times out (TIMED_OUT / FAILED).

Requirements:
    - Running Conductor server with conductor-python >= 1.3.11
    - export AGENTSPAN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:6767/api
    - LLM provider configured
