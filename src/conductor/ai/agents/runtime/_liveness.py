"""Worker liveness verification + stall detection.

Two complementary mechanisms protect against the "pollCount=0" failure
mode where a Conductor task sits queued forever because no Python worker
is polling for it.

``LocalLivenessCheck.verify`` runs synchronously after worker registration
and confirms each expected worker subprocess is alive. ``ServerLivenessMonitor``
runs as a daemon thread during ``AgentHandle.join()`` and watches for
SCHEDULED tasks in our domain that exceed a stall threshold.

See ``docs/design/2026-05-06-worker-liveness-and-idempotent-resume.md``.
